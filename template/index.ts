But that other part was too concerned about living to not care about helping something so small. So she sat and held the tiny moth in her hand, feeling it’s whispering feet on her palm as it flexed it’s wings slowly. The late morning sun beaming into the closed windows of her small Volkswagen.</p><p id="8780" data-selectable-paragraph="">She had almost crushed the moth as she parked. How long had it been in the car without her noticing it? Just as she pulled up to his house she happened to look down and there it was, motionless, on the shift cover. If she shifted into reverse, it would be crushed, so instead of backing her little tan car into his driveway as she usually did, she found an open spot a few houses down.</p><p id="7866" data-selectable-paragraph="">Setting the parking brake gently, she scoped it up in her hand and held it. One wing was torn, and it seemed to be moving as if to test it, raising and lowering its wings slowly at first, then a bit faster. She watched as it gained confidence. Enjoying this moment. Stalling.</p><p id="5399" data-selectable-paragraph="">The moment would be over if he saw her. He’d rush out, ready with plans for their time together. “Let it go, come inside.” But he couldn’t see her. Great sweeping branches of ancient trees curtained the street. They teamed with birds, leaves thick enough that she could only see hints of the Victorian house he’d bought two years ago.</p><p id="c23c" data-selectable-paragraph="">He had remodeled it himself, every detail perfect. Iron fencing, widow’s walk, wide oak doors like the jaws of a castle. He took two months to pick out the Cerulean paint. The house was grand, colorful, and beautiful in every way this tiny brown moth was not.</p><p id="5ae6" data-selectable-paragraph="">The moth lifted itself from her palm and lighted higher on her arm. Having learned it could still fly, it now wanted to do nothing else, and it took off, fluttering erratically around the car and landing on the dashboard. She quickly scooped it up in cupped hands.</p><p id="1d2b" data-selectable-paragraph="">“Okay, little one,” She said. “Time to go.”</p><p id="6751" data-selectable-paragraph="">She closed the moth gently in her right hand, opened the door, and got out of her car. Standing under the trees, she thrust the moth upward as if presenting it to heaven. It’s wings caught the air and it fluttered above her for a moment before a sweeping streak of blue flashed in front of her eyes and it was gone.</p><p id="2df7" data-selectable-paragraph="">Teary, she stood for a moment and stared into the spot of the tree where the jay had flown, listening to the laughter of the birds. Slowly, another part of herself lifted one foot, then another, and carried her in the direction of the house.</p></div>
